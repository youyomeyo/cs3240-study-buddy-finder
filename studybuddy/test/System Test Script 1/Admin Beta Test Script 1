Beta Testing Admin Script 1

Admin please remember to fill out the “beta testing results” form for each user (max 1 page length) of any unexpected
activities that occur during this process, so we can fix them!
Also please ask users about any suggestions, thoughts and comments on the UX design and functionalities of the website.
At the end of the test if the user has any other general comments, you can add them to the chart with “final” in the
column for “Test number - script step”.
Also, if the user decides to try/test other functionalities, please add them to the bottom of the chart and put “extras”
in the column for “Test number - script step”. This is optional based on the user!
